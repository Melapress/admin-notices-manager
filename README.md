## Description
Tired of ever-present notices in the WordPress administration?

## Dependencies

1. [Node >= 8.11 & NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - Build packages and 3rd party dependencies are managed through NPM, so you will need that installed globally.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- `cd` into the plugin folder
- run `composer install --no-dev` to install necessary composer dependencies (for production build only)
- run `npm install` to install necessary npm dependencies

## NPM Commands

- `npm run translate` (regenerate the POT translation file)
- `npm run zip` (build ZIP file for release)
