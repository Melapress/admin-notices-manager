Better manage admin notices and never miss important developer messages!

== Description ==

WordPress core, themes and plugins developers use admin notices to send you important messages about your website and their software that you use. However, more often than not a cry wolf situation is created due to the overwhelming number of notices and the nature of these messages.

Use the Admin Notices Manager plugin to better manage your websiteâ€™s admin notices. Read them at your own convenience and never miss an important WordPress core and developer message.

##The problem

Pretty much anyone who uses WordPress knows about admin notices. Unfortunately though, they have a negative connotation of them. Very often users are overwhelmed by the number of admin notices that pop up on their WordPress dashboard. Sometimes there are so many that the WordPress dashboard is below the scroll.

This has resulted in users ignoring the admin notices and not reading important messages and information from WordPress core, plugins and also themes developers.

##The solution

The Admin Notices Manager plugin solves this problem by moving the admin notices out of the main dashboard view to a central place, so you are not disrupted. 

This allows you to keep on working and read the notices at your convenience at a later time, without missing any important WordPress core, plugins and themes messages.

##How it works

The plugin is very easy to use; simply install and activate it on your WordPress website and it will automatically capture all the notifications.

The plugin notifies you of new notices by highlighting the number of new notices in the WordPress toolbar next to your username.
